# Repository notes for Claude

## Navigation

- **`index.html` structure:** see `docs/index-structure.md` before scanning
  the file. It maps the in-flow `.app` shell, the overlay siblings, and the
  script groups by line range and `id`.

## Maintenance rules

- **Keep `docs/index-structure.md` in sync.** If you edit `index.html` and
  any of the following change, update the doc in the same commit:
  - a section in `.app` is added, removed, reordered, or renamed
  - an overlay (`consent-overlay`) is added or removed
  - an `id` referenced by JS is added, removed, or renamed
  - the script load order / grouping changes
  - the `?v=NNN` cache-bust scheme changes
- Line numbers in the doc are approximate — don't chase a few lines of drift,
  but do refresh them when a section moves significantly.

## Cache-bust

Every asset URL in `index.html` ends in `?v=NNN`. The same number lives in
`sw.js` (`CACHE_NAME = 'mounce-bbg-greek-pwa-vNN'` and the precache list).
Bump both together on release.

## Porting from duff_study_tool

This repo is a Mounce-flavoured port of `hutima/duff_study_tool`. The
"Mounce ↔ duff differences" section of `docs/index-structure.md` captures
the persistent gotchas (changelog absence, paradigm-file naming, session
presets, off-the-record parsing). Consult it before applying a duff diff.

### Porting status — last version ported

**Last reviewed duff commit: `7cb83ad` (tip of duff `main`, 2026-06-21; merge of
PR #299).** When checking for new duff work, diff `origin/main` against that
commit forward.

- **Ported in full through duff #288** (parsing undo + 3-tier scoring,
  restructured parse summary + "Why this form" notes, 3rd-person imperative
  parsing at Mounce ch 33, and "Build mode" / interactive paradigm lookup).
- **Ported duff #296** — SRS rework: lapse **relearn ladders** (a slip no
  longer wipes a card — it relearns then resumes at ½ its pre-lapse interval,
  `preLapseIntervalDays`), a gentler **8-month/relaxed cadence** (near-linear
  14→28→42→56→60, ~60-day cap, `maxEasyStepDays`), a **leech** drill (relaxed,
  after 4 Hard lapses), and **variant-form gating "Model B"** — a shared
  base+derived set advances only once every active face is passed in one cycle
  (`cycleFacesPassed`/`getVariantCycleInfo`/`isCardDue`), **replacing** the
  weakest-active-face grading from the variant-forms back-fill. New progress
  fields (`inRelearn`/`relearnLeft`/`preLapseIntervalDays`/`lapseCount`/
  `leechDrill`/`leechStreak`/`cycleFacesPassed`) are seeded, whitelisted in the
  save compaction, and cleared on reset; `faceOutcomes` is gone. Also folded in
  duff #296's syncretic middle/passive "Your parse" form-lookup fix. The
  Mounce-side draft PR #81 (SRS only, deferred the gating) was the cross-check
  and is closed in favour of this fuller port. **Follow-up:** the earlier #296
  port covered only the SRS half — its analytics half (`de7c8f1`) is now in too:
  parsing accuracy scores **per dimension** (`countLemmaFormDimCredit`) so a
  4-of-5-dims parse counts 0.8, not the old whole-parse 0, feeding the headline %
  and per-value bars (the strict 2/2 dots / exclude-known rule is unchanged).
  Captions say "Per-dimension accuracy"; the old whole-parse
  `countLemmaFormCredit` / `recentAttemptCredit` / `recentAttemptOutcome` chain
  was removed (matching duff).
- **Ported duff #297** — parsing undo credit is now `0.5^(undos+1)` (a single
  undo → 0.25, was 0.5).
- **Ported duff #298 + the remaining tip-of-main commits:**
  - **#298 (`c0f41ee`) — variant "Uncertain re-queues a face" (SRS).** A variant
    "… as cards" set now advances only when **every active face is CLEARED with
    Easy** in one cycle. Easy clears a face (held 2h, hidden); **Uncertain
    re-queues just that face for 2h** (siblings stay active) and never completes
    the set; a miss still resets the whole cycle. Adds a per-face
    `cycleFacesHeld` map (face → re-show time) beside `cycleFacesPassed`, wired
    through `getWordProgress` (seed + sanitize), `isCardDue` (hide Easy-cleared
    faces until the set completes; hide Uncertain faces only until their 2h hold
    elapses), `applySpacedReview`, `migrations.js` (empty-check + compaction),
    and the spaced-progress reset. Replaces the old "Uncertain counts as a pass"
    behaviour from the #296 gating port.
  - **`69880d8` — touch ghost-click shield.** "I give up" collapses the step
    rows, sliding "Next →" under the finger; the browser's re-dispatched touch
    click hit Next and skipped the summary. A 200ms `morphGiveUpShieldUntil`
    stamp (set in `giveUpMorphologyStep`, checked in `handleNavNext`) swallows
    it.
- **Ported duff's post-#298 tip-of-main commits (not yet PR'd in duff):**
  - **Aorist collapse** (`f650d3d`) — the parsing Tense step collapsed
    first/second aorist to plain `aorist` via
    `dims.tense = dims.tense.replace(/^(first |second )/, '')` in *both*
    `computeAccessibleDimensionPools` (distractor pool) and `buildMorphSteps`
    (correct value + summary) in `morph_steps.js`. First/second aorist is a
    stem-formation distinction, not a tense, so the step no longer offers
    "second aorist" beside "aorist" (Mounce data ships `"… 2nd aorist active"`
    parses, so this matters here too). Aspect + the stem-change footer are
    unaffected.
  - **Variant gating no longer bypassed in relearn/leech** (duff #299,
    `94b3976`) — `applySpacedReview`'s per-face gate was guarded by `if (variant
    && !inRelearn && !leechDrill)`, so once a heavily-lapsed variant set (e.g.
    ἵστημι) entered the relearn/leech ladder a single correct answer on ONE face
    (or an easy+uncertain mix) advanced the ladder and scheduled the whole set
    out, stranding the unreviewed siblings. Fix: drop the `!inRelearn &&
    !leechDrill` guard (`if (variant)`) so the ladder step (`applyCorrectOutcome`)
    fires only when the cycle completes — every active face cleared with Easy —
    and a lapsed set relearns together as documented. (duff's other two
    post-#298 commits, `2f12bdd`/the #299 merge, are duff back-porting Mounce
    #86 into duff — no new Mounce content.)
  - **Parsing review panel scoped to the custom set** (`d5a7a8c`) — in
    custom-paradigm-set mode the bottom panel becomes a live scorecard for the
    ticked deck (`runtime.parsingCustomParadigms`), showing selected-but-undrilled
    paradigms and dropping drilled paradigms outside the set; nothing is pinned;
    labels become "Custom set: N" / "Selected paradigms". (`customMode`/`baseStats`
    in `renderParsingReviewPanel`.)
- **Mounce-specific (no duff equivalent):**
  - **Default parsing review panel shows ALL in-scope paradigms** — not just
    drilled ones. Outside custom mode `baseStats` = every chapter-gate-met
    concrete paradigm (`host.getInScopeParadigmLemmas` →
    `listAvailableParadigms(...).filter(!isAggregate)`) unioned with any drilled
    lemma, so unseen-but-in-scope paradigms are visible (and an attempt under a
    now-out-of-scope chapter still shows). Label: "Paradigms: X drilled · Y in
    scope". duff only has the custom-mode scoping above; this general default is
    a Mounce extension layered on the same `customMode`/`baseStats` plumbing —
    portable back to duff.
  - **Pooled optional-form de-dup** — `collectCardsForLemmas` (paradigm_focus.js)
    collapses `OPT_*` cards by `(form, parse)` across shuffle-all /
    category-shuffle / custom-set pools. Variant-family members share one
    `optionalFormGroups` set (`registerVariants`) and the synthetic optional id
    embeds the lemma, so each λύω principal part re-emitted the same optional
    forms; core cards keep id-dedup.
  - **λύω infinitives regrouped** — `'λύω infinitive forms'` moved from the
    one-entry "Infinitives" optgroup into `Verbs · standard ω-pattern (λύω)`
    (infinitives are indeclinable; participles stay separate).
- **Optional-paradigm completeness audit (`lemma_inventory.js`).** Every Mounce
  verb paradigm was checked for optional-form coverage (matters for wrong-parse
  lookup as well as the optional-extension toggle). Verbs WITH coverage before:
  λύω, γίνομαι, δίδωμι, τίθημι, ἵστημι. Added now, **ported verbatim from duff**
  (Greek + parses; chapters remapped to Mounce):
  - **λαμβάνω** (`'λαμβάνω → ἔλαβον'`) and **λείπω** (`'λείπω → ἔλιπον'`) — full
    optional coverage (present/imperfect/future indicative, 2nd-aorist
    subj/impv/inf, aorist passive, perfect, present + 2nd-aorist active + aorist
    passive participles), bringing the 2nd-aorist actives to γίνομαι parity.
  - **κρίνω** (`'κρίνω → κρινῶ'`) — participles (present κρίνων, **1st**-aorist
    κρίνας `-ας/-αντος`, aorist passive κριθείς) as `extraForms` ONLY (no
    drillable optional groups), mirroring duff — they back wrong-parse feedback.
  - Two new participle helpers: `aoristActiveParticipleParadigm(stem)` (2nd-aorist
    `-ών` type, e.g. λαβών/λιπών) and `presentActiveNtParticiple(accStem,
    bareStem, neuter)` (recessive `-ων` type), alongside the existing
    `aoristPassiveParticipleParadigm`.
  - **Hand-authored (no duff source)** — now also complete:
    - **ἀγαπάω / ποιέω / πληρόω** (α/ε/ο contracts): present-system gaps —
      present mid/pas indicative, imperfect active + mid/pas indicative, present
      infinitives (act + MP), present MP participle (via new
      `menosParticipleParadigm`), present active participle recognition
      nominatives (full contracted `-ῶν/-οῦντος` declension deferred). Future/
      aorist/perfect are uncontracted/regular, so not added.
    - **γράφω** (`'γράφω → ἐγράφην'`): 2nd-aor-passive non-indicatives (subj
      γραφῶ, impv γράφηθι, inf γραφῆναι, ptc γραφείς via new θ-less
      `eisParticipleParadigm`) + present active indicative.
    - **πορεύομαι** (`'πορεύομαι → πορεύσομαι'`): present + imperfect middle
      indicative, aorist (passive-form) ἐπορεύθην, present/aorist inf + impv,
      present middle participle (menos) + aorist passive participle (θ-type).
    - **δείκνυμι** (`'δείκνυμι (no reduplication)'`): present active indicative +
      inf, 1st-aorist ἔδειξα + inf, present/aorist active participle recognition
      nominatives (full μι-/-ας declensions deferred). All gated at Ch 36.
    - New helpers: `menosParticipleParadigm(accStem, bareStem, label)` (λυόμενος
      2-1-2 pattern, also handles contracted stems) and `eisParticipleParadigm`
      (θ-less 2nd-aor passive `-είς`). Every Mounce-drilled verb now has optional
      coverage; remaining gaps are the deferred accent-dense participle
      declensions noted above.
- **Added the "Irregular practice" selector section** (duff #269's
  `buildIrregularPracticeSelector` / `#irregularGrid`) — the five stem-flip
  flashcard sets (second-aorist / liquid-future / aorist-passive /
  perfect-active / μι-verb, changed letters diff-highlighted) now sit in their
  own selector section instead of being scattered through the per-week
  Supplemental groups. **Adapted, not copied:** duff's version rides on its
  chapter-regrouped Supplemental selector (#269–#272, skipped here), so Mounce
  keeps its week-grouped `buildSupplementalSelector` — it just skips flip sets
  (`isFlipSet`) and lists them in the new section ordered by `set.week`, via a
  shared `renderSupplementalEntry`. No `HIDDEN_SUPPLEMENTAL_KEYS`
  (`W4_SECOND_AORIST_STEMS` doesn't exist here). `deselectAllSupplementals` now
  leaves the other sections alone (`isParadigmPracticeKey`); `deselectAllIrregular`
  clears just the flip sets. NB: `stem_change_drills.js` here is still dormant —
  it points at duff-only `W4_*_STEMS` arrow-delimited vocab keys Mounce lacks,
  so it registers nothing (the flip sets carry the stem highlighting instead).
- **Fixed a latent crash** (not a duff change): `escapeAttr` was used in
  `syncParsingCustomParadigmsUi` but never defined in `main.js`, so entering
  parsing mode threw — now defined.
- **Back-filled the generalized "Variant forms as cards" panel** (duff #272 +
  #273 + #277) — earlier ports had skipped it as "duff irregular-cards infra
  Mounce lacks," but Mounce ships all five flip sets, so it was just wiring.
  `IRREGULAR_CARD_CONFIGS` generalizes the old single `secondAoristCards` toggle
  to 5 (`2aor`/`lfut`/`aorpass`/`perfact`/`mi`), each default-on once its Mounce
  chapter (20/22/24/25/34) is selected, plus "Show tense on irregular cards".
  Adapted: Mounce chapters/flip keys, the `flipLookupKey` accent fold kept on
  both sides, and a `secondAoristCards → irregularCards` save migration. So
  #272/#273/#277's irregular-cards bits are no longer "skipped." (If a NEWER
  duff PR refines this infra, it's now portable here.)
- **#289–#292 — evaluated; mostly skipped as duff-specific (not translatable):**
  - **#289** "Required only → Starred words only" rename — **skip**: Mounce uses
    "required / optional" everywhere (the `(req.)/(opt.)` card tags), so renaming
    just the toggle would clash. Its Advanced-settings reorg (reset / progress
    collapsibles) is duff's own layout.
  - **#290** Reset-actions / Progress layout reorg — **skip** (duff layout). The
    "star non-name Ch.1 vocab" (ἀμήν, ῥαββί) is duff's BBG Chapter 1; Mounce's
    chapter vocab differs, so starring is a Mounce content decision, not a port.
  - **#291** "Merge legacy supplemental sets away" (W1O/W3O/W6O/W7O/W8O →
    chapters/grammar; `LEGACY_GRAMMAR_TIE`) — **N/A**: Mounce has no
    `week_N_supplemental` / `wNo_supplemental` files. Chapter-grouped selector
    consistency — **N/A** (Mounce groups by Part). **Applied:** the one
    model-agnostic bit — hide the empty controls-bar frame in reader mode
    (`syncLayoutVisibility`).
  - **#292** selector spacing tweak — **skip** (rides on #289's starred toggle).
  - **#293–#294** CSS fixes to `.selector-required-toggle` (dead margin /
    30px→15px gap) — **N/A**: that mirror "Starred words only" toggle is #289's,
    which Mounce never added, so there's no element to style.
